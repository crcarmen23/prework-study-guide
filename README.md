# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to be a website that holds notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript, and to show what was taught in the coding bootcamp prework section. It is intended to be used as a study guide in the future, as well as something to look back on to see how far I've come. It solves the problem of not having one place to keep all of my notes, and by creating it myself, I have already learned an immense amount about web development.
